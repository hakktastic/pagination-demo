# 🚀 Pagination Demo

A demo REST Api showing **pagination concepts** using Spring Boot and Maven in a backend 
application.

## 🧠 Why use pagination
In this demo application I used e prefilled PostgreSQL database with 1.000.000 records. Five key 
reasons to use pagination:
1. **⚡ Performance Improvement** – Fetching only a subset of data reduces memory and CPU usage on 
   both 
server and client. 
2. **⏱️ Faster Response Times** – Smaller datasets are transmitted and rendered more quickly in 
   APIs or web pages. 
3. **🖥️ Better User Experience** – Users aren’t overwhelmed by huge lists; data is presented in 
   manageable chunks. 
4. **🌐 Reduced Network Load** – Limits the amount of data sent over the network, saving bandwidth. 
5. **📈 Scalability** – Makes your application able to handle large datasets efficiently as it grows.
